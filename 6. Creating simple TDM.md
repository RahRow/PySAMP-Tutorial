# Creating simple TDM

## Preparing

Let's start with the simplest one. Create the file `player.py` and in it create the class `Player()`. We will also use `sqlite3`. You will learn the basics of `sqlite3`, but I highly recommend the official [documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html)

## Writing code

```python
# */python/player.py
players = {} 

class Player():
    def __init__(player_id, player_name):
        self.player_id = player_id
        self.player_name = player_name
        self.player_money = 0
        self.player_score = 0
        self.player_death = 0
        self.player_team = -1
```
We will keep the money, the score, the number of deaths and the team.

Now let's create a file `handler.py` in our folder, this file will be responsible for storing and processing player data. You can also choose not to do this and instead do all the database stuff in the main file, but I prefer to create a separate file. I will call it `handler.py`. 

```python
# */python/handler.py
import sqlite3

class DataBase():
    def __init__(self, database):
        self.database = database 
        self.connection = sqlite3.connect(database)
        self.cursor = self.connection.cursor()


        



```
