# Gangzones

Gangzones are highly recommended for Gang/TDM gamemodes. In this tutorial we will expand the gangzones.

## Writing Code

### Preparing

We need to import `on_gamemode_init` and the module `callbacks`. Since we will be working with gangzones, we import `Gangzone()` class from the `gangzone` module and the class `Player()` from the `player` module. Also dialogs will be used in commands, so import `cmd` from `commands`

```python
from pysamp import (
    on_gamemode_init,
    on_gamemode_exit
)
from pysamp.gangzone import Gangzone
from pysamp.player import Player
from pysamp.commands import cmd
```

I also suggest using `add_player_class()` to keep your player from falling underground.

```python
from pysamp import add_player_class
@on_gamemode_init
def your_function():
    add_player_class(0, 2484.0, -1660.0, 1.5781, 265.4560, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)
```

We are done with the preparations, now let's start creating gangzones.

### Creating gangzones

First things first, lets talk about how a gangzone created, gangzones are a 4-sided shape.

```
        MinY
            v
    MinX > *-------------
            |            |
            |  Gangzone  |
            |   center   |
            |            |
            -------------* < MaxX
                        ^
                        MaxY
```

There are lots of ways to create a gangzone (mapeditor, /save command, gangzone fs, etc ...), but you can also create gangzones via [GTA SA gangzone editor ](https://dev.prineside.com/gtasa_gangzone_editor/) website which will help you to create gangzone 4-sided shape

### Creating Gangzones

you can create an instance of Gangzone out of any function in a single file and then import it everywhere to access that gangzone exactly.

```python
# zones.py
first_gangzone = Gangzone(1572.0, -2323.0, 1739.0, -2245.0)
```

```python
from .zones import first_gangzone
```

### There are several methods for every gangzone

<hr>

```python
@cmd
def zone_id(player: Player):
    print(first_gangzone.get_id())
```

here we have unique ID for every gangzone and to access that, there is a method called `Gangzone.get_id()`.
and to destroy the gangzone you can user `Gangzone.destroy()`

<hr>

```python
@Player.on_connect
def show_zone(player: Player):
    first_gangzone.show_for_player(player, 0xFF0000FF)
```

the `show_for_player` method is used to show a gangzone to a player in the map. this method get 2 arguments, first argument for the player object (the player that we wanted to show gangzone to it), and second argument is about the ganzone color.

<hr>

```python
@cmd
def hide_zone(player: Player):
    first_gangzone.hide_for_player(player)
```

the `hide_for_player` method is used to hide a gangzone for a player in the map. this method get only one argument, which that is for the player object (the player that we wanted to show gangzone to it).

<hr>

```python
@cmd
def load_zones(player: Player):
    first_gangzone.show_for_all(0xFF0000FF)
```

the `show_for_all` method is similar to the `show_for_player` method but the only difference is about their actions, and `show_for_all` cover the **ALL OF THE ONLINE PLAYERS**.

<hr>

```python
@cmd
def unload_zones(player: Player):
    first_gangzone.hide_for_all(0xFF0000FF)
```

the `hide_for_all` method is similar to the `hide_for_player` method but the only difference is about their actions, and `hide_for_all` cover the **ALL OF THE ONLINE PLAYERS**.

<hr>

```python
@cmd
def war(player: Player):
    first_gangzone.flash_for_player(player, 0xFFFFFFFF)
```

the `flash_for_player` method is a useful method in gangzones which it will change gangzone color every second to another color that you can choose that color. this method get 2 arguments, first argument for the player object (the player that we wanted to show gangzone to it), and second argument is about the ganzone flash color.

<hr>

```python
@cmd
def surrender(player: Player):
    first_gangzone.stop_flash_for_player()
```

the `stop_flash_for_player` method is used for stop flashing action on the specific area.

<hr>

```python
@cmd
def war_all(player: Player):
    first_gangzone.flash_for_all(0xFF0000FF)
```

the `flash_for_all` method is similar to the `flash_for_player` method but the only difference is about their actions, and `flash_for_all` cover the **ALL OF THE ONLINE PLAYERS**.

<hr>

```python
@cmd
def surrender_all(player: Player):
    first_gangzone.stop_flash_for_player()
```

the `stop_flash_for_all` method is similar to the `stop_flash_for_player` method but the only difference is about their actions, and `stop_flash_for_all` cover the **ALL OF THE ONLINE PLAYERS**.

<hr>

## **Notice:**

- there are lots of method for showing the gangzone to a player or bunch of players and the one that i recommend to use is `Gangzone.show_for_player(...)`.

- some methods like `show_for_all`, `hide_for_all`, `flash_for_all`, `stop_flash_for_all` their effect is for the players they are connected before, which it means is you call `show_for_all` and then after calling that function a player join server, the gangzone isn't visible for the player.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial you learned how to work with gangzones, in the next tutorial you will learn how to work with menus.
