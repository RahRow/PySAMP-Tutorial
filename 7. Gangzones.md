# Gangzones

Gangzones are highly recommended for Gang/TDM gamemodes. In this tutorial we will expand the gangzones.

## Writing Code

### Preparing

We need to import `on_gamemode_init` and the module `callbacks`. Since we will be working with gangzones, we import `Gangzone()` class from the `gangzone` module and the class `Player()` from the `player` module. Also dialogs will be used in commands, so import `cmd` from `commands`

```python
from pysamp import (
    on_gamemode_init,
    on_gamemode_exit
)
from pysamp.gangzone import Gangzone
from pysamp.player import Player
from pysamp.commands import cmd
```

I also suggest using `add_player_class()` to keep your player from falling underground.

```python
from pysamp import add_player_class
@on_gamemode_init
def your_function():
    add_player_class(0, 2484.0, -1660.0, 1.5781, 265.4560, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)
```

We are done with the preparations, now let's start creating gangzones.

First things first, lets talk about how a gangzone created, gangzones are a 4-sided shape.

### Useful software

There are several means to create gangzones:
* [GangZone Maker](http://www.mediafire.com/?7gd25gto2vb5uxb)
* [GangZone Online Editor](https://dev.prineside.com/ru/gtasa_gangzone_editor/)


### Creating Gangzones

You can create a class instance and use it, or you can create a dictionary and store the gangzones there. 

```python
# python/zones.py
gangzone = Gangzone(1572.0, -2323.0, 1739.0, -2245.0)
```

Or another way.

```python
# python/zones.py
gangzones = {}
gangzones[0] = Gangzone(1572.0, -2323.0, 1739.0, -2245.0)
```

In the future we will use the first method, as it is more obvious.

### Methods

Each gangzone has its own unique ID. To get it there is a method `get_id()`. Let's look at an example of a simple command.

```python
@cmd
def zoneid(player: Player):
    print(gangzone.get_id())
```

So now you know how to get an ID. There is also the `destroy()` method. This method will destroy our gangzone.

```python
@cmd 
def destroyzone(player: Player):
    gangzone.destroy()
```

That's it, now the gangzone will not be visible, because it has been removed.

Often, you will show gangzones to the player when he connects, for this we will use the `@Player.on_connect` event.

The `show_for_player()` method is used for this. It takes two arguments: `player` and `color`. The `player` is the player to whom the gangzone will be shown, `color` is the color of the gangzone.

```python
@Player.on_connect
def on_player_connect(player: Player):
    gangzone.show_for_player(player, 0xFF0000FF)
```

There is also a similar method `hide_for_player()` that hides the gangzone for the player. Let's use it as an example of a command. This method takes the `player` argument, so this is the player for whom we want to hide the gangzone.

```python
@cmd
def hide(player: Player):
    gangzone.hide_for_player(player)
```

You can also show gangzones for everyone, there is a method `show_for_all()` for this. You'll probably use it when loading a mode, but here we'll break it down with an example command.

```python
@cmd
def showall(player: Player):
    gangzone.show_for_all(0xFF0000FF)
```

Accordingly, to hide gangzones from all players, use the `hide_for_all()` method.

```python
@cmd
def hideall(player: Player):
    gangzone.hide_for_all(0xFF0000FF)
```

The `flash_for_player()` method and another similar method (which will come later) will be used almost every time you create an interaction between players and gangzones. This method forces the gangzone to flash with color. So it takes to arguments: `player` and `color`.

```python
@cmd
def flash(player: Player):
    gangzone.flash_for_player(player, 0xFFFFFFFF)
```

The `stop_flash_for_player()` method makes the gangzone stop changing color.


```python
@cmd
def stopflash(player: Player):
    gangzone.stop_flash_for_player()
```

The `flash_for_all()` method will make the gangzone flash color for all players (all players will see it).

```python
@cmd
def flashall(player: Player):
    gangzone.flash_for_all(0xFF0000FF)
```

The `stop_flash_for_player()` method will make the gangzone stop changing color for all players.

```python
@cmd
def stopall(player: Player):
    gangzone.stop_flash_for_player()
```

### Notice:

* Methods like: `show_for_all()`, `hide_for_all()`, `flash_for_all()`, `stop_flash_for_all()` they works for players who are connected to. That means that if you call `show_for_all()` and then the player joins the server after calling this function, the gangzone will not be visible to the player.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial you learned how to work with gangzones, in the next tutorial you will learn how to work with menus.
=======
There are lots of ways to create a gangzone (mapeditor, /save command, gangzone fs, etc ...), but you can also create gangzones via [GTA SA gangzone editor ](https://dev.prineside.com/gtasa_gangzone_editor/) website which will help you to create gangzone 4-sided shape

### Creating Gangzones

you can create an instance of Gangzone out of any function in a single file and then import it everywhere to access that gangzone exactly.

```python
# zones.py
first_gangzone = Gangzone(1572.0, -2323.0, 1739.0, -2245.0)
```

```python
from .zones import first_gangzone
```

### There are several methods for every gangzone

<hr>

```python
@cmd
def zone_id(player: Player):
    print(first_gangzone.get_id())
```

here we have unique ID for every gangzone and to access that, there is a method called `Gangzone.get_id()`.
and to destroy the gangzone you can user `Gangzone.destroy()`

<hr>

```python
@Player.on_connect
def show_zone(player: Player):
    first_gangzone.show_for_player(player, 0xFF0000FF)
```

the `show_for_player` method is used to show a gangzone to a player in the map. this method get 2 arguments, first argument for the player object (the player that we wanted to show gangzone to it), and second argument is about the ganzone color.

<hr>

```python
@cmd
def hide_zone(player: Player):
    first_gangzone.hide_for_player(player)
```

the `hide_for_player` method is used to hide a gangzone for a player in the map. this method get only one argument, which that is for the player object (the player that we wanted to show gangzone to it).

<hr>

```python
@cmd
def load_zones(player: Player):
    first_gangzone.show_for_all(0xFF0000FF)
```

the `show_for_all` method is similar to the `show_for_player` method but the only difference is about their actions, and `show_for_all` cover the **ALL OF THE ONLINE PLAYERS**.

<hr>

```python
@cmd
def unload_zones(player: Player):
    first_gangzone.hide_for_all(0xFF0000FF)
```

the `hide_for_all` method is similar to the `hide_for_player` method but the only difference is about their actions, and `hide_for_all` cover the **ALL OF THE ONLINE PLAYERS**.

<hr>

```python
@cmd
def war(player: Player):
    first_gangzone.flash_for_player(player, 0xFFFFFFFF)
```

the `flash_for_player` method is a useful method in gangzones which it will change gangzone color every second to another color that you can choose that color. this method get 2 arguments, first argument for the player object (the player that we wanted to show gangzone to it), and second argument is about the ganzone flash color.

<hr>

```python
@cmd
def surrender(player: Player):
    first_gangzone.stop_flash_for_player()
```

the `stop_flash_for_player` method is used for stop flashing action on the specific area.

<hr>

```python
@cmd
def war_all(player: Player):
    first_gangzone.flash_for_all(0xFF0000FF)
```

the `flash_for_all` method is similar to the `flash_for_player` method but the only difference is about their actions, and `flash_for_all` cover the **ALL OF THE ONLINE PLAYERS**.

<hr>

```python
@cmd
def surrender_all(player: Player):
    first_gangzone.stop_flash_for_player()
```

the `stop_flash_for_all` method is similar to the `stop_flash_for_player` method but the only difference is about their actions, and `stop_flash_for_all` cover the **ALL OF THE ONLINE PLAYERS**.

<hr>

## **Notice:**

- there are lots of method for showing the gangzone to a player or bunch of players and the one that i recommend to use is `Gangzone.show_for_player(...)`.

- some methods like `show_for_all`, `hide_for_all`, `flash_for_all`, `stop_flash_for_all` their effect is for the players they are connected before, which it means is you call `show_for_all` and then after calling that function a player join server, the gangzone isn't visible for the player.
