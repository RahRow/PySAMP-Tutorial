# Actors

In this tutorial you will learn how to create actors, the official documentation says: "*Create a static 'actor' in the world. These 'actors' are like NPCs, however they have limited functionality. They do not take up server player slots.*" We'll create an actor and break down all the functions associated with them.

## Writing code

### Preparing

Let's create an actor by importing the `Actor()` class. We also import `on_gamemode_init` and the `callbacks` module. We will also often work with commands, so we import the `cmd` from `commands` and the `Player()` class.

```python
from pysamp import on_gamemode_init, add_player_class
from pysamp import callbacks
from pysamp.actor import Actor
from pysamp.player import Player
from pysamp.commands import cmd
```

Don't forget to write it at the bottom:

```python
callbacks.hook()
```

So, we will create an actor using the `create()` function. Also this code will be written in `@on_gamemode_init`, so that the actor will be created as soon as the mod is started. I also suggest using `add_player_class()` to keep your player from falling underground.

```python
@on_gamemode_init
def your_function():
    add_player_class(0, 134.0484, -67.3721, 1.5781, 265.4560, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)
    global actor
    actor = Actor.create(3, 143.6142, -65.3830, 1.5781, 104.4560)
```

### Callbacks

Actors can work with two callbacks. These are `@Actor.on_stream_in` and `@Actor.on_stream_out`. The first is called when the actor enters the player's draw zone. The second is respectively called when the actor leaves the player's draw zone.

Let's write them and send a message to the player that will show the ID and HP of the actor. To do this, there is a function `get_id()` and `get_health()`.

```python
@Actor.on_stream_in
def on_actor_stream_in(actor: Actor, forplayer: Player):
    forplayer.send_client_message(-1, f"You can see actor with id: {actor.get_id()}. Actor's health: {actor.get_health()}")
```

Now let's do the same thing in the second callback, but we won't get the actor's ID.

```python
@Actor.on_stream_out
def on_actor_stream_out(actor: Actor, forplayer: Player):
    forplayer.send_client_message(-1, f"You can't see actor with id: {actor.get_id()}")
```

As you can see, there is nothing complicated about the actors.  Now let's start working with the functions.

### Functions

Actors have several functions, some of which we have already discussed above. I will talk about the functions of actors in order. 

Let's start with the `destroy()` function. This function destroys the actor. Let's see how this looks like with a simple command.

```python
@cmd
def destroyactor(player: Player):
    player.send_client_message(-1, f"Actor with id: {actor.get_id()} was destroyed")
    actor.destroy()
```

The next function is `is_streamed_in()`. This function checks if the actor is in the rendering area. It doesn't make much sense to use this function in commands, let's use it in `@Player.on_spawn`.

```python 
@Player.on_spawn
def on_player_spawn(player: Player):
    if actor.is_streamed_in():
        player.send_client_message(-1, f"You can see actor with id: {actor.get_id()}")
```

The following functions are `get_virtual_world()` and `set_virtual_world()`. The first function allows you to find out the ID of the virtual world, the second allows you to change it. Note that if your virtual world is different from the actor's world, you will not see actor.

```python
@cmd 
def worldactor(player: Player):
    player.send_client_message(-1, f"Actor's virtual world: {actor.get_virtual_world()}")
```

Now let's change the virtual world.

```python
@cmd 
def setactorworld(player: Player):
    actor.set_virtual_world(3) # for example
    player.send_client_message(-1, f"Actor's virtual world has been changed to")
```

Now let's start working with the animations for the actors. I'll show a simple example of a conversation animation. In general, actors can play a huge number of animations. For this, there is a function `apply_animation()`.

```python
@cmd
def animationactor(player: Player):
    actor.apply_animation("GANGS", "prtial_gngtlkA", 4.1, False, 0, 0, 0, 0)
```

You can also change the `loop=True` argument. I do not recommend changing the `delta` argument to something else. Also, the `freeze` argument if set to `True` will freeze the player after the animation ends.

You shouldn't have any problems with the `clear_animations()` function, it just stops the animation of the actor.

```python
@cmd 
def stopactor(player: Player):
    actor.clear_animations()
```

Now let's deal with the actor's position. There are functions `get_position()` and `set_position()`. The first function allows you to know the actor's position, the second allows you to change the position.

```python
@cmd 
def actorpos(player: Player):
    player.send_client_message(-1, f"Actor's XYZ: {actor.get_position()}")
```

Nothing complicated, is it? Now let's parse `set_position()`, note that you have to pass a **tuple** to the function.

```python
@cmd 
def setactorpos(player: Player, x: float, y: float, z: float):
    actor.set_position((x, y, z))
    player.send_client_message(-1, "Actor's position has been changed")
```

Next are the `get_facing_angle()` and `set_facing_angle()` functions, which are similar to `get_position()` and `set_position()`. However, these functions change the angle of view of our actor. Since they are similar, we only slightly change our previous commands.

```python
@cmd 
def actorangle(player: Player):
    player.send_client_message(-1, f"Actor's facing angle: {actor.get_facing_angle()}")
```
Now let's use the `set_facing_angle()` function.

```python
@cmd 
def actorsetangle(player: Player, angle: float):
    actor.set_facing_angle(angle)
    player.send_client_messagee(-1, "Actor changed the angle")
```

Let's move on. The function `get_health()` we already used at the very beginning, the function `set_health()` allows you to change the actor's health.

```python
@cmd 
def sethpactor(player: Player, health: float):
    actor.set_health(50.0)
```

We have practically disassembled all the functions of the actors.

The `is_invulnerable()` and `set_invulnerable()` functions are responsible for making the actor invulnerable. You can find out if an actor is invulnerable using `is_invulnerable()`, and you can also make an actor invulnerable using `set_invulnerable()`. Also, to make the actor vulnerable again you can use `set_invulnerable(False)`.

```python 
@cmd 
def isactorinvulnerable(player: Player):
    player.send_client_message(f"{actor.is_invulnerable()}")
```
Now make the actor invulnerable.

```python
@cmd 
def setactorinvulnerable(player: Player):
    actor.set_invulnerable()
    player.send_client_message(-1, f"Now the Actor is invulnerable")
```

Now let's write a command that makes the actor vulnerable again.

```python
@cmd 
def removeactorinvulnerable(player: Player):
    actor.set_invulnerable(False)
    player.send_client_message(-1, f"Actor is now vulnerable")
```
