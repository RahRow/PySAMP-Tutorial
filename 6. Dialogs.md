# Dialogs

Dialogs in SA:MP are one of the most important things for player interaction. In this tutorial, we'll take a full look at the dialogs.

## Writing code

### Preparing

We need to import `on_gamemode_init` and the module `callbacks`. Since we will be working with commands, we import `Dialog()` class from the `dialog` module and the class `Player()` from the `player` module. Also dialogs will be used in commands, so import `cmd` from `commands`

```python
from pysamp import on_gamemode_init, add_player_class
from pysamp.dialog import Dialog
from pysamp.player import Player
from pysamp.commands import cmd
from pysamp import callbacks
```

I also suggest using `add_player_class()` to keep your player from falling underground.

```python
@on_gamemode_init
def your_function():
    add_player_class(0, 134.0484, -67.3721, 1.5781, 265.4560, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)
```

We are done with the preparations, now let's start creating dialogs.

### Creating Dialogs

First, let's create a dialog, and I'll also show you a few ways to do it. To create a dialog, use the `create()` function. But before I do, I should tell you that there are several types of dialogs. We will work with `DIALOG_STYLE_MSGBOX`. Later I will tell you about all the other types.

At the beginning of the code, you have to write this.

```python 
DIALOG_STYLE_MSGBOX = 0
DIALOG_STYLE_INPUT = 1
DIALOG_STYLE_LIST = 2
DIALOG_STYLE_PASSWORD = 3
DIALOG_STYLE_TABLIST = 4
DIALOG_STYLE_TABLIST_HEADERS = 5
```

So let's begin by showing you two ways to create dialogs. They are pretty much the same, but you should see them.

```python
@cmd 
def dialogcommand(player: Player):
    dialog = Dialog.create(DIALOG_STYLE_MSGBOX, "Title", "First string\nSecond string", "Close", "")
```

```python
@cmd 
def dialogcommand(player: Player):
    Dialog.create(DIALOG_STYLE_MSGBOX, "Title", "First string\nSecond string", "Close", "")
```

As you can see, they are similar. However, in the future I will use the second method.

Now let's deal with the dialogues themselves. As I said earlier, the `create()` function creates a dialog.

As you can see we've already created a dialog, Also, our dialog has one button. This is because the argument `button_2` is an empty string (we didn't write anything there).

Now let's take apart the `show()` function. As the name implies, this function shows a dialog to the player. Let's try it out.

```python
@cmd 
def dialogcommand(player: Player):
    Dialog.create(DIALOG_STYLE_MSGBOX, "Title", "First string\nSecond string", "Close", "").show(player)
    # or dialog = ...
    # dialog.show(player)
```

The dialog will now be visible to the player.

Now let's deal with `on_response`. In `on_response` it will be necessary to pass the function that will be responsible for processing the dialog, also I will explain the code of this function later.


```python
def msgbox_response(player: Player, response: int, list_item: int, input_text: str):
    if response:
        player.send_client_message(-1, "Thank you for response")
    
    else:
        player.send_client_message(-1, "You closed dialog")
```

So, `if response` is responsible for whether the player pressed `button_1`. The `else` block will be called if the player pressed `button_2` or pressed ESC key. Note that `list_item` and `input_text` will be described later, since it is not used in `DIALOG_STYLE_MSGBOX`. Now edit the previous code.

```python
@cmd 
def dialogcommand(player: Player):
    Dialog.create(DIALOG_STYLE_MSGBOX, "Title", "First string\nSecond string", "Close", "", on_response=msgbox_response).show(player)
```

Now let's start working with `DIALOG_STYLE_INPUT` and I won't describe `DIALOG_STYLE_PASSWORD` since they are the same (except for the visual hiding of the password). 

```python
@cmd
def inputdialog(player: Player):
    Dialog.create(DIALOG_STYLE_INPUT, "Input Title", "Write something below", "Ok", "Close", on_response=input_response).show(player)
```

Let's change the function that will be responsible for processing the dialog.

```python
def input_response(player: Player, response: int, list_item: int, input_text: str):
    if response:
        player.send_client_message(-1, f"You typed: {input_text}")
    
    else:
        player.send_client_message(-1, "You closed dialog")
```

As you can see, this is similar to what we wrote earlier. Now let's make a new dialog, which will be of type `DIALOG_STYLE_LIST`.

```python
@cmd
def listdialog(player: Player):
    Dialog.create(DIALOG_STYLE_LIST, "List Title", "Option 1\nOption 2\nOption 3", "Ok", "Close", on_response=list_response).show(player)
```

Now our function will look different, since we used the `DIALOG_STYLE_LIST` type, it is now possible to interact with `list_item`. Notice that the countdown starts at 0.

```python
def list_response(player: Player, response: int, list_item: int, input_text: str):
    if response:
        if list_item == 0:
            player.send_client_message(-1, "You chose option 1") #input_text = option 1

        if list_item == 1:
            player.send_client_message(-1, "You chose option 2")

        if list_item == 2:
            player.send_client_message(-1, "You chose option 3")
    
    else:
        player.send_client_message(-1, "You closed dialog")
```

Now let's take apart the `DIALOG_STYLE_TABLIST`. This dialog type was added recently (in 2015). It is similar to `DIALOG_STYLE_LIST` but you can create columns.

```python
@cmd
def tablistdialog(player: Player):
    Dialog.create(DIALOG_STYLE_TABLIST, "Tablist Title", "Option 1\tColumn 1\tColumn 2\nOption 2\tColumn 3\tColumn 4", "Ok", "Close", on_response=tablist_response).show(player)
```

```python
def tablist_response(player: Player, response: int, list_item: int, input_text: str):
    if response:
        if list_item == 0:
            player.send_client_message(-1, "You chose option 1") #input_text = Option 1

        if list_item == 1:
            player.send_client_message(-1, "You chose option 2")
    
    else:
        player.send_client_message(-1, "You closed dialog")
```

As you can see, they do look alike. Now let's take apart the last type, namely `DIALOG_STYLE_TABLIST_HEADERS`. This dialog type is similar to `DIALOG_STYLE_TABLIST`, except that the former allows you to create headers.

```python
@cmd
def tablistheaderstdialog(player: Player):
    Dialog.create(DIALOG_STYLE_TABLIST, "Tablist Headers Title", "Header 1\tHeader 2\nOption 1 Column 1\tOption 1 Column 2\nOption 2 Column 1\tOption 2 Column 2", "Ok", "Close", on_response=tablist_headers_response).show(player)
```

```python
def tablist_headers_response(player: Player, response: int, list_item: int, input_text: str):
    if response:
        if list_item == 0:
            player.send_client_message(-1, "You chose option 1") #input_text = Option 1 Coloumn 1

        if list_item == 1:
            player.send_client_message(-1, "You chose option 2")
    
    else:
        player.send_client_message(-1, "You closed dialog")
```

You may have found the last example a bit difficult, but in fact there is nothing complicated about it. 

## Conclusion
