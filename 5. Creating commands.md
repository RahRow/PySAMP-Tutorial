# Creating commands

Let's look at a situation where you need to create a command. Of course, you can use [`OnPlayerCommandText()`](https://open.mp/docs/scripting/callbacks/OnPlayerCommandText).

## Writing code

```python
def OnPlayerCommandText(playerid, cmdtext):
    if cmdtext == "/pysamp":
        SendClientMessage(playerid, -1, "Hello from tutorial!")
        return True
    
    return True
```

Of course it will work. But what if we want arguments to be entered into our command? Callback [`OnPlayerCommandText()`](https://open.mp/docs/scripting/callbacks/OnPlayerCommandText) will not let us do this. In this case we can use `CMDParser`. We'll take it apart and write some commands. First, note that you need to create a file in your directory (I will call it `commands.py` and will use this name from now on) and then you need to copy the [code](https://github.com/pysamp/PySAMP/blob/object-oriented-api/pysamp/commands.py) into your file.

First, you need to delete these lines:

```python
from .callbacks import registry

registry.register_callback(
    'OnPlayerCommandText',
    dispatcher.handle,
    'pysamp.commands',
)

```

Now back to callback [`OnPlayerCommandText()`](https://open.mp/docs/scripting/callbacks/OnPlayerCommandText).

```python
from .commands import dispatcher, cmd

def OnPlayerCommandText(playerid, cmdtext):
    dispatcher.handle(playerid, cmdtext)
    return True
```

Now let's rewrite our command.

```python
@cmd
def pysamp(playerid: int):
    SendClientMessage(playerid, -1, "Hello from tutorial!")
    return True
```
You can also use another way, which will be shown below. To do this, you must specify `use_function_name`

```python
@cmd(use_function_name=True) # name of the command (/cmd_pysamp)
def cmd_pysamp(playerid: int):
    SendClientMessage(playerid, -1, "Hello from tutorial!")
    return True
```

Let's create a simple command that adds up the integers Let's call it "`/calculate`". I will use the first way to create commands. but you can use the way you prefer.

```python
@cmd
def calculate(playerid: int, a: int, b: int):
    SendClientMessage(playerid, -1, f"Result: {a + b}")
    return True
```
You will notice that we are adding strings, not numbers. Let's fix that
.Also note that the player may enter nothing or he may enter a string instead of a integer, so let's use `try`, `except`.

```python
@cmd
def calculate(playerid: int, a: int=None, b: int=None):
    if a is None:
        SendClientMessage(playerid, -1, f"You have to specify the first integer!")
        return True

    if b is None:
        SendClientMessage(playerid, -1, f"You have to specify the second integer!")
        return True
 
    try:
        a_int = int(a)
        b_int = int(b)

    except:
        SendClientMessage(playerid, -1, f"You did not enter an integer!")
        return True
    
    SendClientMessage(playerid, -1, f"Result: {a_int + b_int}")
    return True
```

I intentionally made this code very simple so that you can understand it.

Now create a command "`/kick`", but it will only be available to the Administrator. We will use the [`IsPlayerAdmin()`](https://open.mp/docs/scripting/functions/IsPlayerAdmin) check.

```python
@cmd
def kick(playerid: int, player_id: int=None):
    if not IsPlayerAdmin(playerid):
        SendClientMessage(playerid, -1, f"You are not an Administrator!")
        return True 

    if player_id is None:
        SendClientMessage(playerid, -1, f"Usage: /kick [player_id]!")
        return True 

    Kick(int(player_id))
    return True
```

If you are not the Administrator, you will get an error that you cannot use this command.

I will not write the rest of the checks, I think you can do it yourself. You can experiment and try different ways, and if you have problems check out our [Discord](https://discord.gg/xR5h6Gpuye) server.

Let's add a kick reason. We can of course use `split_args`. But I'll show you an easier way. From a tuple we make a string using `join()` function.

```python
def kick(playerid, player_id: int=None, *reason):
    str_reason = " ".join(reason)
    if not IsPlayerAdmin(playerid):
        SendClientMessage(playerid, -1, f"You are not an Administrator!")
        return True 

    if player_id is None:
        SendClientMessage(playerid, -1, f"You must specify player ID!")
        return True

    SendPlayerMessage(int(player_id), -1, f"You were kicked, reason: {str_reason}")
    Kick(int(player_id))
    return True
```

So now let's deal with the `aliases`. This is easy, let's take the `/pysamp` command as an example

```python
@cmd(aliases=("samppy", "mppy"))
def pysamp(playerid: int=None):
        SendClientMessage(playerid, -1, f"Hello from tutorial!")
        return True
```
Our command now has several names, each of which will work

## Conclusion

You have learned how to use cmdparser, and now you know how to create commands. In the next tutorial we will create a simple **TDM gamdemode** that will work with `sqlite3`, also we will cover more functions.
