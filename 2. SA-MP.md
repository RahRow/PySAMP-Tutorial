### Notes

* 1. Although the vehicle model limit in 0.3 is unlimited, if you use a large amount of vehicle models, you may notice parts of your mode become framey as vehicle models are dynamically loaded/unloaded. Keeping the number of vehicle models *below 150 is a good idea**.
* 2. Although the textdraw string limit is **1024** characters, if colour codes (e.g. ~r~) are used beyond the 255th character it may **crash the client**.
* 3. It is possible to show all Textdraws at the same time for one player, however this is **not recommended**.
* 4. To circumvent these limits, it is possible to use a streamer. Streamers work by only creating the objects/vehicles etc. that are close to players. See here (vehicles not supported, but there are streamers out there for those).
* 5. Due to client limitations only up to **51 actors may actually be shown at a time**.
* 6. Vehicle ID's start at ID 1 and thus range **from 1 to 1999**, even if **MAX_VEHICLES is 2000**. Objects and player objects also **start at ID 1**.
