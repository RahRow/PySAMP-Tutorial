# Creating first gamemode

It's time to write your gamemode. First, let's write a **simple freeroam**. We will use [this](https://github.com/pysamp/PySAMP/blob/main/gamemodes/grandlarc/gamemode.py) mod as a "sample", but **it is outdated**, so we will write our own, then we will take apart our code.

**We won't work with lists, it's not efficient. Instead we will use dictionaries.**

## Preparing

Create the file `__init__.py`. In it we import all the functions
**from PySAMP**.
Don't forget to install Python.

```python
from samp import *
```

You can also import only what you need.

```python
from samp import OnGameModeInit, OnGameModeExit # example
```

## Writing code

Let's start writing the code, first we will write the basic functions, you can also take them from the previous article.
Every time you start up the [`OnGameModeInit()`](https://open.mp/docs/scripting/callbacks/OnGameModeInit) function is called. This function is a [callback](https://open.mp/docs/scripting/callbacks), the function [`OnGameModeExit()`](https://open.mp/docs/scripting/callbacks/OnGameModeExit) is called when you close the program accordingly. Let's look at it clearly.

```python
def OnGameModeInit():
    return True

def OnGameModeExit():
    return True
```

As you can see it works. Let's create a file `player.py` in which we create a player class.

```python
# */python/player.py
players = {}

class Player():
    def __init__(self, playerid, player_name):
        self.playerid = playerid
        self.player_name = player_name
        self.player_city_id = -1
        self.selected_city = False
```
`playerid` = Player ID.

`player_name` = Player name.

`player_city_id` = City ID.

`selected_city` = Whether the player has selected a city or not.

Now let's adjust the weather, turn off bonuses and more. We will use the following functions: [`ShowPlayerMarkers()`](https://open.mp/docs/scripting/functions/ShowPlayerMarkers), [`ShowNameTags()`](https://open.mp/docs/scripting/functions/ShowNameTags), [`SetNameTagDrawDistance()`](https://open.mp/docs/scripting/functions/SetNameTagDrawDistance), [`EnableStuntBonusForAll()`](https://open.mp/docs/scripting/functions/EnableStuntBonusForAll), [`DisableInteriorEnterExits()`](https://open.mp/docs/scripting/functions/DisableInteriorEnterExits), [`SetWeather()`](https://open.mp/docs/scripting/functions/SetWeather)

```python
def OnGameModeInit():
    ...
    ShowPlayerMarkers(1)
    ShowNameTags(True)
    SetNameTagDrawDistance(40)
    EnableStuntBonusForAll(False)
    DisableInteriorEnterExits()
    SetWeather(2)
    return True
```

We also need to use the function [`AddPlayerClass()`](https://open.mp/docs/scripting/functions/AddPlayerClass) which will create a **player class**. We take the classes directly from the original.

```python
def OnGameModeInit():
    ...
    AddPlayerClass(1,1759.0189,-1898.1260,13.5622,266.4503,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1)

    AddPlayerClass(91,1759.0189,-1898.1260,13.5622,266.4503,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1)
    AddPlayerClass(92,1759.0189,-1898.1260,13.5622,266.4503,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1)
    AddPlayerClass(93,1759.0189,-1898.1260,13.5622,266.4503,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1)

    return True
```
Now the player when entering the server can choose a skin, but now you can not see it, because we have not implemented the spawn. Let's write the callbacks [`OnPlayerConnect()`](https://open.mp/docs/scripting/callbacks/OnPlayerConnect) and [`OnPlayerDisconnect()`](https://open.mp/docs/scripting/callbacks/OnPlayerDisconnect). As you understand they are responsible for connecting and disconnecting the player from the server. Remember that we are working with the dictionary. So our key will be `playerid`. Let's also add a text that will appear to the player, when entering. We will use the function [`GameTextForPlayer()`](https://open.mp/docs/scripting/functions/GameTextForPlayer). The colors can be found (**GameText**) [here](https://open.mp/docs/scripting/resources/colorslist). Also remember to import the class and dictionary. To get a player's name, use [`GetPlayerName()`](https://open.mp/docs/scripting/functions/GetPlayerName)

```python
from .player import Player, players
```

```python
def OnPlayerConnect(playerid):
    GameTextForPlayer(playerid, "~w~Grand Larceny", 3000, 4)
    players[playerid] = Player(playerid, GetPlayerName(playerid))
    return True
```

Now let's delete the player data in [`OnPlayerDisconnect()`](https://open.mp/docs/scripting/callbacks/OnPlayerDisconnect). You can use `del` or `pop()`

```python
def OnPlayerDisconnect(playerid, reason):
    del players[playerid]
    return True
```

Let's start working with [`OnPlayerSpawn()`](https://open.mp/docs/scripting/callbacks/OnPlayerSpawn). This callback is called when the player spawns. The callback [`OnPlayerRequestSpawn()`](https://open.mp/docs/scripting/callbacks/OnPlayerRequestSpawn) is called when the player **is going** to spawn. We also check if the player is an NPC, for this there is a function [`IsPlayerNPC()`](https://open.mp/docs/scripting/functions/IsPlayerNPC). We also need to set the interior, we use the function [`SetPlayerInterior()`](https://open.mp/docs/scripting/functions/SetPlayerInterior). We need interior `0` (street). Let's use the [`TogglePlayerClock()`](https://open.mp/docs/scripting/functions/TogglePlayerClock) function to turn the game clock on or off, I'll turn it off. Also, **sometimes the player is given $100 when he is spawned**, so we will fix this and use the function [`ResetPlayerMoney()`](https://open.mp/docs/scripting/functions/ResetPlayerMoney). I will also give the player $500 using the function [`GivePlayerMoney()`](https://open.mp/docs/scripting/functions/GivePlayerMoney).

```python
def OnPlayerSpawn(playerid):
    if IsPlayerNPC(playerid):
        return True
    
    SetPlayerInterior(playerid, 0)
    TogglePlayerClock(playerid, 0)
    ResetPlayerMoney(playerid)
    GivePlayerMoney(playerid, 500)
    return True
```

We can give weapons and skills for players. Let's do this using the functions [`SetPlayerSkillLevel()`](https://open.mp/docs/scripting/functions/SetPlayerSkillLevel) and [`GivePlayerWeapon()`](https://open.mp/docs/scripting/functions/GivePlayerWeapon).

```python
def OnPlayerSpawn(playerid):
    ...
    SetPlayerSkillLevel(playerid, 0, 200)
    SetPlayerSkillLevel(playerid, 1, 200)
    SetPlayerSkillLevel(playerid, 2, 200)
    SetPlayerSkillLevel(playerid, 3, 200)
    SetPlayerSkillLevel(playerid, 4, 200)
    SetPlayerSkillLevel(playerid, 5, 200)
    SetPlayerSkillLevel(playerid, 6, 200)
    SetPlayerSkillLevel(playerid, 7, 200)
    SetPlayerSkillLevel(playerid, 8, 200)
    SetPlayerSkillLevel(playerid, 9, 200)
    SetPlayerSkillLevel(playerid, 10, 200)
    GivePlayerWeapon(playerid, 22, 100) 
    return True
```
Do you remember that we are creating a freeroam? This means that we need to set up a callback [`OnPlayerDeath()`](https://open.mp/docs/scripting/callbacks/OnPlayerDeath) which is called when a player dies. Let's also use the function [`SendDeathMessage()`](https://open.mp/docs/scripting/functions/SendDeathMessage) so that players see the death of another player in the statistics.

```python
def OnPlayerDeath(playerid, killerid, reason):
    SendDeathMessage(killerid, playerid, reason)
    if killerid == 65535:
        ResetPlayerMoney(playerid)
        return True 

    GivePlayerMoney(killerid, GetPlayerMoney(playerid))
    ResetPlayerMoney(playerid)
    return True
```

You may be asking what the line means

```python
if killerid == 65535:
    ...
```

ID `65535` is `INVALID_PLAYER_ID`, you must do a check, otherwise this will cause [`OnPlayerDeath()`](https://open.mp/docs/scripting/callbacks/OnPlayerDeath) to fail.

Now let's start working with TextDraws. We focus on the original mod, so we will create TextDraws in the functions. I strongly recommend that you download auxiliary tools:
* [TDEitor](https://www.burgershot.gg/showthread.php?tid=340)
* [Nickk's TextDraw Editor](https://github.com/Nickk888SAMP/TextDraw-Editor)

Let's start by creating TextDraws. We will use the function [TextDrawCreate()](https://open.mp/docs/scripting/functions/TextDrawCreate). Remember that our variables will be in the local scope, so we will use the keyword `global`. The function that will create the TextDraws I will call `init_textdraws()`. Remember that we have three cities to choose from, as well as an auxiliary textdraw. There will be **four in all**

```python
def init_textdraws():
    global textdraw_los_santos
    global textdraw_san_fierro
    global textdraw_las_venturas
    global textdraw_helper
    textdraw_los_santos = TextDrawCreate(10.0, 380.0, "Los Santos")
    textdraw_san_fierro = TextDrawCreate(10.0, 380.0, "San Fierro")
    textdraw_las_venturas = TextDrawCreate(10.0, 380.0, "Las Venturas")
    textdraw_helper = TextDrawCreate(10.0, 415.0,
        " Press ~b~~k~~GO_LEFT~ ~w~or ~b~~k~~GO_RIGHT~ ~w~to switch cities.~n~ Press ~r~~k~~PED_FIREWEAPON~ ~w~to select.")
    return True
```
Let's set up our TextDraws. First, let's go back to [`OnGameModeInit()`](https://open.mp/docs/scripting/callbacks/OnGameModeInit) and call the function `init_textdraws()` there

```python
def OnGameModeInit():
    ...
    init_textdraws()
    return True
```

Now create a function that will customize our TextDraws (color, font, and so on). I will call this function `init_city_name_textdraw()`. This function will take the text of our TextDraw as argument. We will use the following functions: [`TextDrawUseBox()`](https://open.mp/docs/scripting/functions/TextDrawUseBox), [`TextDrawLetterSize()`](https://open.mp/docs/scripting/functions/TextDrawLetterSize), [`TextDrawFont()`](https://open.mp/docs/scripting/functions/TextDrawFont), [`TextDrawSetShadow()`](https://open.mp/docs/scripting/functions/TextDrawSetShadow), [`TextDrawSetOutline()`](https://open.mp/docs/scripting/functions/TextDrawSetOutline), [`TextDrawColor()`](https://open.mp/docs/scripting/functions/TextDrawColor). **I highly recommend that you read about these functions to understand what is going on at all**

```python
def init_city_name_textdraw(textdraw_text):
    TextDrawUseBox(textdraw_text, 0)
    TextDrawLetterSize(textdraw_text, 1.25, 3.0)
    TextDrawFont(textdraw_text, 0)
    TextDrawSetShadow(textdraw_text, 0)
    TextDrawSetOutline(textdraw_text, 1)
    TextDrawColor(textdraw_text, 4008636159)
    return True
```

Now let's add our function `init_textdraws()` and call the function `init_city_name_textdraw()` there, also let's create a similar function, but it will only configure `textdraw_helper`. Let's call it `init_textdraw_helper()`.

```python
def init_textdraw_helper(textdraw_text):
    TextDrawUseBox(textdraw_text, 1)
    TextDrawBoxColor(textdraw_text, 572662459)
    TextDrawLetterSize(textdraw_text, 0.3, 1.0)
    TextDrawTextSize(textdraw_text, 400.0, 40.0)
    TextDrawFont(textdraw_text, 2)
    TextDrawSetShadow(textdraw_text, 0)
    TextDrawSetOutline(textdraw_text, 1)
    TextDrawBackgroundColor(textdraw_text, 255)
    TextDrawColor(textdraw_text, 4294967295)
    return True
```

```python
def init_textdraws():
    ...
    init_city_name_textdraw(textdraw_los_santos)
    init_city_name_textdraw(textdraw_san_fierro)
    init_city_name_textdraw(textdraw_las_venturas)
    init_textdraw_helper(textdraw_helper)
    return True
```

Let's now create a function that will set the camera position according to the selected city. Let's call this function `set_player_spawn_pos()`. This function will take `playerid` as an argument. We will also use the functions: [`SetPlayerInterior()`](https://open.mp/docs/scripting/functions/SetPlayerInterior), [`SetPlayerPos()`](https://open.mp/docs/scripting/functions/SetPlayerPos), [`SetPlayerFacingAngle()`](https://open.mp/docs/scripting/functions/SetPlayerFacingAngle), [`SetPlayerCameraPos()`](https://open.mp/docs/scripting/functions/SetPlayerCameraPos), [`SetPlayerCameraLookAt()`](https://open.mp/docs/scripting/functions/SetPlayerCameraLookAt)

```python
def set_player_spawn_pos(playerid):
    if players[playerid].player_city_id == 0:
        SetPlayerInterior(playerid,11)
        SetPlayerPos(playerid, 508.7362, -87.4335, 998.9609)
        SetPlayerFacingAngle(playerid, 0.0)
        SetPlayerCameraPos(playerid, 508.7362, -83.4335, 998.9609)
        SetPlayerCameraLookAt(playerid, 508.7362, -87.4335, 998.9609)

    if players[playerid].player_city_id == 1:   
        SetPlayerInterior(playerid, 3)
        SetPlayerPos(playerid, -2673.8381, 1399.7424, 918.3516)
        SetPlayerFacingAngle(playerid, 181.0)
        SetPlayerCameraPos(playerid,-2673.2776, 1394.3859, 918.3516)
        SetPlayerCameraLookAt(playerid, -2673.8381, 1399.7424, 918.3516)

    if players[playerid].player_city_id == 2:
        SetPlayerInterior(playerid, 3)
        SetPlayerPos(playerid, 349.0453, 193.2271, 1014.1797)
        SetPlayerFacingAngle(playerid ,286.25)
        SetPlayerCameraPos(playerid, 352.9164, 194.5702, 1014.1875)
        SetPlayerCameraLookAt(playerid, 349.0453, 193.2271, 1014.1797)  

    return True
```

Now we need to create a function that will hide TextDraw from the player, and will also set the camera position for cities. Let's call the function `setup_selected_city()`. It also takes `playerid`. We have used similar functions before. We will also use the function [`TextDrawHideForPlayer()`](https://open.mp/docs/scripting/functions/TextDrawHideForPlayer).

```python
def setup_selected_city(playerid):
    if players[playerid].city_selection == -1:
        players[playerid].city_selection = 0
        
    if players[playerid].city_selection == 0:
        SetPlayerInterior(playerid, 0)
        SetPlayerCameraPos(playerid, 1630.6136, -2286.0298, 110.0)
        SetPlayerCameraLookAt(playerid, 1887.6034, -1682.1442,47.6167)
        TextDrawShowForPlayer(playerid, textdraw_los_santos)
        TextDrawHideForPlayer(playerid, textdraw_san_fierro)
        TextDrawHideForPlayer(playerid, textdraw_las_venturas)

    if players[playerid].city_selection == 1:
        SetPlayerInterior(playerid,0)
        SetPlayerCameraPos(playerid, -1300.8754, 68.0546, 129.4823)
        SetPlayerCameraLookAt(playerid, -1817.9412, 769.3878, 132.6589)
        TextDrawShowForPlayer(playerid, textdraw_san_fierro)
        TextDrawHideForPlayer(playerid, textdraw_los_santos)
        TextDrawHideForPlayer(playerid, textdraw_las_venturas)

    if players[playerid].city_selection == 2:
        SetPlayerInterior(playerid,0)
        SetPlayerCameraPos(playerid, 1310.6155, 1675.9182, 110.7390)
        SetPlayerCameraLookAt(playerid, 2285.2944, 1919.3756, 68.2275)
        TextDrawShowForPlayer(playerid, textdraw_las_venturas)
        TextDrawHideForPlayer(playerid, textdraw_los_santos)
        TextDrawHideForPlayer(playerid, textdraw_san_fierro)
   
    return True
```

Now let's create a function that will change the city to the next one. Let's also play a certain sound, when you change city. To do this, there is a function [`PlayerPlaySound()`](https://open.mp/docs/scripting/functions/PlayerPlaySound). Let's call the function `city_switch_next`. This function will take `playerid` as an argument. This function will also call `setup_selected_city()`

```python
def city_switch_next(playerid):
    players[playerid].city_selection += 1
    if players[playerid].city_selection > 2:
        players[playerid].city_selection = 0
    
    PlayerPlaySound(playerid, 1052, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)
    setup_selected_city(playerid)
    return True
```

Let's create a similar function that returns us to the previous city. Let's call the function `city_switch_previous`. This function will take `playerid` as an argument too.

```python
def city_switch_previous(playerid):
    players[playerid].city_selection -= 1
    if players[playerid].city_selection < 0:
        players[playerid].city_selection = 2

    PlayerPlaySound(playerid, 1052, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)
    setup_selected_city(playerid)
    return True
```

Now let's create a function that will get information about which keys player pressed. This is necessary to make a change of city. We will use the function [`GetPlayerKeys()`](https://open.mp/docs/scripting/functions/GetPlayerKeys) and [`TogglePlayerSpectating()`](https://open.mp/docs/scripting/functions/TogglePlayerSpectating). When player press certain keys, we will change the city (call the function). Let's call this function `handle_city_selection()`. It will take the argument `playerid`.

```python
def handle_city_selection(playerid):
    (keys, ud, lr) = GetPlayerKeys(playerid)
    if players[playerid].city_selection == -1 : 
        city_switch_next(playerid)

    if keys & 4:
        players[playerid].selected_city = True
        TextDrawHideForPlayer(playerid, textdraw_los_santos)
        TextDrawHideForPlayer(playerid, textdraw_san_fierro)
        TextDrawHideForPlayer(playerid, textdraw_las_venturas)
        TextDrawHideForPlayer(playerid, textdraw_helper)
        TogglePlayerSpectating(playerid, False)

    if lr > 0:
        city_switch_next(playerid)
            
    elif lr < 0:
        city_switch_previous(playerid)
    
    return True
```

Now add the callback [`OnPlayerRequestClass()`](https://open.mp/docs/scripting/callbacks/OnPlayerRequestClass). We'll also write a check on NPCs (we'll take from [`OnPlayerSpawn()`](https://open.mp/docs/scripting/callbacks/OnPlayerSpawn). We will spawn the player if he has already chosen a city. We will also check if the player is in spectator mode, we will use the function [`GetPlayerState()`](https://open.mp/docs/scripting/functions/GetPlayerState). We will spawn the player if he is not in spectator mode, otherwise he will be disconnected from the server. To do this, we will use the new function [`SpawnPlayer()`](https://open.mp/docs/scripting/functions/SpawnPlayer)

```python
def OnPlayerRequestClass(playerid, classid):
    if IsPlayerNPC(playerid):
        return True

    if players[playerid].selected_city == True:
        set_player_spawn_pos(playerid)
        return True
            
    else:
        if GetPlayerState(playerid) != PLAYER_STATE_SPECTATING:
            SpawnPlayer(playerid)
            TogglePlayerSpectating(playerid, 1)
            TextDrawShowForPlayer(playerid, textdraw_helper)
            players[playerid].city_selection = -1
    
    return True
```

Now let's start working with the callback [`OnPlayerUpdate()`](https://open.mp/docs/scripting/callbacks/OnPlayerUpdate). First, let's check whether the player is connected or not. To do this, we have the function [`IsPlayerConnected()`](https://open.mp/docs/scripting/functions/IsPlayerConnected). Let's also check if the player is an NPC (you already know how to do this). Let's also call the function `handle_city_selection()` if the player has not yet chosen a city and is in observation mode. Also, if the player is in the interior or is holding a weapon, we will give him the weapon "Fists" (`ID 0`). For this, we use the function [`SetPlayerArmedWeapon()`](https://open.mp/docs/scripting/functions/SetPlayerArmedWeapon). To get the weapon we will use [`GetPlayerWeapon()`](https://open.mp/docs/scripting/functions/GetPlayerWeapon). Also in the original mod **Minigun and Jetpack are not allowed**, so let's kick the player using the function [`Kick()`](https://open.mp/docs/scripting/functions/Kick).

```python
def OnPlayerUpdate(playerid):
    if not IsPlayerConnected(playerid):
        return False

    if IsPlayerNPC(playerid):
        return True

    if players[playerid].selected_city == False and GetPlayerState(playerid) == PLAYER_STATE_SPECTATING:
        handle_city_selection(playerid)
    
    if GetPlayerInterior(playerid) != 0 and GetPlayerWeapon(playerid) != 0:
        SetPlayerArmedWeapon(playerid, 0)
        return False
    
    if GetPlayerWeapon(playerid) == 38 or GetPlayerSpecialAction(playerid) == 2:
        Kick(playerid)
        return False
        
    return True
```

Let's now do a player spawn by referring to [`OnPlayerSpawn`](https://open.mp/docs/scripting/callbacks/OnPlayerSpawn)

```python
def OnPlayerSpawn(playerid):
    ...
    if players[playerid].city_selection == 0:
        SetPlayerPos(playerid, 1751.1097, -2106.4529, 13.5469)

    if players[playerid].city_selection == 1:
        SetPlayerPos(playerid, -2723.4639, -314.8138, 7.1839)

    if players[playerid].city_selection == 2:   
        SetPlayerPos(playerid, 1435.8024, 2662.3647, 11.3926)

    return True
```

You have probably noticed that cities change very quickly. Let's fix this, we can of course complete our `Player()` class, but we will only check **TickCount one time**, so we will use P'vars. However, **they are slow**. So I will show you the way with the class. We will use the functions [`SetPVarInt()`](https://open.mp/docs/scripting/functions/SetPVarInt) and [`GetPVarInt()`](https://open.mp/docs/scripting/functions/GetPVarInt)

### Player Variable method

```python
def city_switch_next(playerid):
    SetPVarInt(playerid, "current_tick_count", GetTickCount())
    ...
    return True
```

```python
def city_switch_previous(playerid):
    SetPVarInt(playerid, "current_tick_count", GetTickCount())
    ...
    return True
```

```python
def handle_city_selection(playerid):
    (keys, ud, lr) = GetPlayerKeys(playerid)
    if players[playerid].city_selection == -1 : 
        city_switch_next(playerid)

    if GetTickCount() - GetPVarInt(playerid, "current_tick_count") < 500:
        return False
        
    ...
    return True
```

I purposely left a bit more code so you can see where to put this.
It works! Now let's do the same thing, but using the `Player()` class.

### Player Class Method

First, let's edit the `Player()` class.

```python
# */python/player.py
players = {}

class Player():
    def __init__(self, playerid, player_name):
        self.playerid = playerid
        self.player_name = player_name
        self.player_city_id = -1
        self.selected_city = False
        self.tick_count = 0
```

Now back to our functions

```python
def city_switch_next(playerid):
    players[playerid].tick_count = GetTickCount()
    ...
    return True
```

```python
def city_switch_previous(playerid):
    players[playerid].tick_count = GetTickCount()
    ...
    return True
```

```python
def handle_city_selection(playerid):
    (keys, ud, lr) = GetPlayerKeys(playerid)
    if players[playerid].city_selection == -1 : 
        city_switch_next(playerid)

    if GetTickCount() - players[playerid].tick_count < 500:
        return False
        
    ...
    return True
```
